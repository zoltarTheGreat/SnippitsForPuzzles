# SnippitsForPuzzles
Creating a project for puzzle sites such as rankk, euler, etc.

In this folder I will have mostly just source code to algorithms that solve the puzzles. There will be no writeups nor will the solution be stored here either. 
  I do not want to ruin the game nor do I want to make higher ups ANGRY ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ‘¿ðŸ‘¿
  DO NOT ask me for solutions. I will DOXX your family (For legal reasons that is a joke)
  I will though take suggestions to making my code more effective and neat. Clean code is good code; and vice versa.
